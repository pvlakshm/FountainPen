Prasad Pens was established in 1953 by Mr. Taniganti Prasada Rao in [Tenali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenali), a town in the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh.

Prasad pens were made of ebonite in mottled green, mottled brown and black, and from celluloid. The clip, the nib and the feed would all have the Prasad lettering. In early models the lettering "Prasad REGD PENWORKS TENALI" can be seen etched on the barrel. In later models, the lettering "Prasad Pen, Tenali" can be seen stamped on the barrel.

In 1977, the company was sold to the Jain family (Mr. Vikas Jain). Prasad pens are no longer produced.
